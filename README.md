## VIII. Original Tiny Flight Simulator Project

Project Tiny Flight Simulator's objective is to create a user-friendly, small-scale flight simulation experience that offers a realistic and immersive flight environment, despite its tiny scope. The project is designed to provide users with a simplified yet authentic flight experience, aimed at both beginners and aviation enthusiasts.

Through the simulator, users will be able to learn the basics of flight mechanics, get hands-on experience of flying different aircraft, and enjoy a visually appealing simulation environment.
